Project Summary
This project involves designing a comprehensive database for the Indian Premier League (IPL) to efficiently manage and track information related to matches, players, and statistics. 
The database stores detailed records of each player's performance, team stats, match results, and tournament standings, facilitating the smooth organization of the league. 
It also enables effective management of tournament data, player rankings, and award distribution, ensuring accurate and accessible information throughout the IPL season.


The database design of Indian Premier League(IPL)

● In this project I have designed a database for Indian Premier League(IPL) which
helps the system to manage the information on matches, players, stats etc.

● This will help to maintain each player's records, information about the
tournament, stats of each and every match which is very well required for the smooth
conduction of the tournaments.

● The database also contains the stats of each and every player as well as every team’s
stats by which we can keep track of their records, match information and point table
can be distributed accordingly, which must be done by a good database.

● The database rather working on each player works for the each match also so that we
can keep track of each match stats and can improve the ranking of each IPL team by it.

It gives us the facility to manage tournaments and awards accordingly.
